# Classification on the ‘Adult’ Data Set: Neural Network and Principal Component Analysis Approaches
### Philip Kerger and Eric Sirinian

We work with the “Adult” Data Set from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository with the goal of comparing the classification methods of Neural Networks and applying PCA to logistic classification. The goal is to successfully classify whether a person earns a salary of $50,000 USD or not based on certain features about the individual. We preprocess the dataset to amend its shortcomings and make it more usable for our machine learning purposes. The issue of having categorical and numerical features is resolved through impact encoding. We design a neural network and a logistic classifier. Improvements are made by changing the activation function from the sigmoid function to the hyperbolic tangent function for the neural network and incorporating PCA with the support vector machine. The obtained correct classifications on our testing data were 74.61% for a basic neural network, 77.08% for the improved neural network, 76.58% for simple logistic classification, and 84.32% for logistic classification with PCA improvements. A discussion follows on the successes and shortcomings of each method implemented.
